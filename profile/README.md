## Hi there!
This is the welcome page of the airqi.com github organization!

We are developing an open-source air pollution platform with maximum transparency.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

## 👋 Before You Start

Read our Manifesto in here: 
and then you can join in.

## 🌈 Contribution guidelines:

We have two main repositories of the platform: the frontend https://github.com/ and the backend https://github.com/

Start by setting up your frontend and backend locally reading the instructions in the `frontend/README.md`
Check the issues and select one you'd like to work on - write in it so that it can be assigned to you
We work with forks, submit PRs, review, aprove and only maintainers can merge and deploy - more about forks: https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks
The automated tests will help you add improvements safely, please extend them too

## 👩‍💻 Communication:

Our Discord community server here: https://discord.com
When you join follow the instructions to present yourself and contact a community lead in the area of your contribution.
